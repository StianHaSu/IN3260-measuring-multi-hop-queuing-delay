# Measuring queuing delays on a multi hop path

## Tasks

1. Get to know ns-3  
2. Set up a topology with a single intermediate node in ns-3  
3. Set up topology with multiple intermediate nodes in ns-3  
4. Test step 3 and 4 by sending fixed sized packets
5. Test step 3 and 4 by sending different packet sizes  
6. Check that packets sent are the correct size under transmission  
7. Measure single hop queuing delay
8. Set TTL for leading packets on multi hop topology
9. Measure cumulative queuing delay on multihop path
10. Build queues on the intermediate nodes
